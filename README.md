# OOP-Final-Project-JU
## This is the final project of my Application Development II class at JU. It uses windows forms and object oriented programming structure.

The objective for this application was to create a pizza ordering app. The user is able to order multiple pizzas
and sides with their choice of toppings, totaling up at the end in a receipt. They are able to modify this sub total before
accepting the transaction, and the form will ask for the users information including an email address. It will send a mock
email to the email address they provide that contains a receipt as well as an estimated time of arrival for the delivery man.
